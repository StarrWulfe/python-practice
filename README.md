# Python Practice
## Learn-2-Code New Year's Resolution
### (...and career switch if things go well ðŸ˜‰)

Just tinkering around with learning python over hereâ€¦

There's a lot I know as insofar as yanking someone else's Python scripts and gussying them up for my own use; I have to do that maybe 3 times a month at work to keep things moving.

**BUT...**

It's a whole 'nother thing to really figure out a solution to a problem programmatically and then implement it in code. I really think coding is kind of the "basic home & auto repair" that everyone in the 21st century needs to know, starting from a primary schooler's age because:

- Kids have no concept of a world without computers, smartphones or the internet. Let that marinate for a sec. Now think about THEIR kids and grandkids someday. They NEED to know this stuff. And by that virtue as their progenitor generation, WE should know it in order to teach it.
- Just like in my parent's day with changing your own oil and installing your own doorbell, you save time & money if you can make basic programs yourself to automate things in your digital life with code.
- Just like there will always be a need for someone to build a house, fix a broken furnace, and check your health, there will always be a need for programmers. Actually, the jobs I just mentioned are probably going to be handled by someone PROGRAMMING something to do all that in the not-to-distant future...

So it's my goal to push ahead and wrap my mind around making programs and one day landing a job where I get to get PAID to do some of this fun stuff, as well as teach my kids how to do this too!
